"Descript_Confirmed_text" = "As if by coincidence, an outbreak of coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, a densely populated city in the center of China, with a population of 12 million. The point here is not even a large crowd of people, but a subtropical humid climate, which in the warm winter of 2020 is an ideal environment for the spread of bacteria.\
\
The main source of contagion is the food markets in China. Seafood, meat, vegetables, eggs - all this contributes to the spread of coronavirus. It is enough for an infected person to sneeze in the area of ​​shopping arcades, and the infection spreads to hundreds of other visitors. Plus, local unsanitary conditions make themselves felt.";
"Descript_Recovered_text" = "The World Health Organization emphasizes:\
today there is no antiviral drug\
with proven effectiveness that can handle\
with COVID-2019.\
\
There is evidence that several drugs are being tested in China, which, based on their mechanisms of action, previously obtained data on the use of other viral infections and the characteristics of the COVID-2019 virus, could have an effect on it, a professor at the Higher School of Health Management told KP Sechenovskiy University Artem Gil. - Firstly, it is an antiretroviral drug (it is used to treat HIV) based on two active substances: lopinavir and ritonavir.\
\
The second drug is remdesivir. More precisely, officially this is not a medicine yet, but a patented active substance (the manufacturer and holder of the patent is a large American biotechnological company). Initially, the drug was tested in the fight against Ebola virus, and infections caused by other RNA viruses (for example, respiratory syncytial virus that causes respiratory diseases). And against them showed signs of antiviral efficacy. Moreover, in preclinical trials on animals, remdesivir \"shot\" against a new type of coronavirus. Therefore, China took this drug for testing, the expert explains.\
\
Russian antiviral agents, including arbidol, ingavirin, kagocel, as well as the Yekaterinburg development of triazavirin, do not have an adequate evidence base that would confirm their effectiveness according to international standards of evidence-based medicine, emphasizes Professor Gil. There are only studies performed at a low methodological level, often on small or very small patient samples. In a word, the “golden” formula for confirming the effectiveness of drugs is not respected. It sounds like a “double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled study,” which should also be properly planned and conducted.\
\
“Therefore, it is extremely doubtful that the Chinese health authorities took any of the Russian antiviral agents for official testing,” the expert notes. - Perhaps, some scientific laboratory, research group in private will decide to try something. However, it is unlikely that the Chinese authorities will test development on their patients without at least preliminary evidence of effectiveness. ”\
\
How are patients with coronavirus infection treated now? Symptomatic therapy is used - depending on the manifestations of the disease, doctors explain. It can be anti-inflammatory, antipyretic drugs, drugs to maintain pressure, respiratory function, etc. \"There is evidence that plasmapheresis can work effectively in patients with a severe form of the disease. That is, blood purification from toxic products of viral infection, ”explains Artem Gil.";
"Descript_Died_text" = "Scientists have proposed to separate the deaths from coronavirus in mainland China and beyond and evaluate the data separately.\
\
The media reports that the death rate in the world is about 2% (divide the number of deaths by the number of infected). Scientists argue that this calculation does not take into account many factors.\
\
It is emphasized that due to overcrowding in Chinese hospitals, only severe cases are included in the statistics, but outside it, the virus is detected more often.\
\
According to the study, with a probability of up to 95%, the mortality rate of the infection is 0.4-4% of all infected. If the virus is fixed in humans within 14 days, then the average figure is 0.9%, and if this period is half as long as 0.8%. This figure is significantly higher than in seasonal flu (0.1%), but significantly lower than that of other SARS and MERS coronaviruses.";

"info_danger" = "As with other respiratory illnesses, infection with 2019-nCoV can cause mild symptoms including a runny nose, sore throat, cough, and fever.  It can be more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties.  More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as, diabetes and heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.";

Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.  As surveillance improves around the world, more coronaviruses are likely to be identified\
\
The animal source of the 2019-nCoV has not yet been identified.  This does not mean you can catch 2019-nCoV from any animal or from your pet. It’s likely that an animal source from a live animal market in China was responsible for some of the first reported human infections. To protect yourself, when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals.\

However, those infected with 2019-nCoV should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials.  WHO is helping to coordinate efforts to develop medicines to treat nCoV with a range of partners.\
\
If you want to protect yourself from getting infected with the new coronavirus, you should maintain basic hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices and avoiding close contact, when possible, with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.The following measures ARE NOT specifically recommended as 2019-nCoV remedies as they are not effective to protect yourself and can be even harmful:\
\
- Taking vitamin C\
- Smoking\
- Drinking tradition herbal teas\
- Wearing multiple masks to maximize protection\
- Taking self-medication such as antibiotics\
\
In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.";
"info_protect" = "Wash your hands frequently\
\
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty.\
\
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub eliminates the virus if it is on your hands.\
\
Practice respiratory hygiene\
\
When coughing and sneezing, cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – discard tissue immediately into a closed bin and clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.\
\
Why? Covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing prevent the spread of germs and viruses. If you sneeze or cough into your hands, you may contaminate objects or people that you touch.\
\
Maintain social distancing\
\
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.\
\
Why? When someone who is infected with a respiratory disease, like 2019-nCoV, coughs or sneezes they project small droplets containing the virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the virus.\
\
\
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth\
\
Why? Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself.\
\
If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early\
\
Tell your health care provider if you have traveled in an area in China where 2019-nCoV has been reported, or if you have been in close contact with someone with who has traveled from China and has respiratory symptoms.\
\
Why? Whenever you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing it’s important to seek medical attention promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Respiratory symptoms with fever can have a range of causes, and depending on your personal travel history and circumstances, 2019-nCoV could be one of them.\
\
If you have mild respiratory symptoms and no travel history to or within China\
\
If you have mild respiratory symptoms and no travel history to or within China, carefully practice basic respiratory and hand hygiene and stay home until you are recovered, if possible.\
\
As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets\
\
Ensure regular hand washing with soap and potable water after touching animals and animal products; avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with hands; and avoid contact with sick animals or spoiled animal products. Strictly avoid any contact with other animals in the market (e.g., stray cats and dogs, rodents, birds, bats). Avoid contact with potentially contaminated animal waste or fluids on the soil or structures of shops and market facilities.\
\
Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products\
\
Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.";
